This repository contains an example of an uncommon code error in Assembly programming: an unhandled memory access.  The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the error, leading to a segmentation fault. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with proper register initialization to avoid the fault.  This example highlights the importance of careful register management in low-level programming.
